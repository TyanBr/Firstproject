# Shortage visa's UK

This was my first ever project that I fully coded up myself. It is essentially a search for whether a job is available for work sponsorship based on the name of the position. This is not going to be constantly up to date as it does not use an API. Additionally, it does not cover every possible job that is sponsorable for a work visa as there are certain limitations. It's only focusing on jobs of shortage in the UK and allows for long-term visa sponsorship. This search excludes religious and sports roles.
